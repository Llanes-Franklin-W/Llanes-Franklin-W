- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Llanes-Franklin-W
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ... History, Myrmecology, Game Design. I enjoy an eclectic mixture of topics, leaning new things is interesting.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... Java, Data Structures, Computer Architecture. 
- ğŸ“« How to reach me ... I can be emailed at llanes.franklin.w@gmail.com.
- âš¡ Fun fact: ... My interest in Computer Programming comes from seeing the Nintendo Entertainment Unit's 8-sprite limit when I was young. I realized that there must be a lot I don't understand about the way a console works and the way a cartridge works.
